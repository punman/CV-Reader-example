# CV-Reader-example

This project is designed to help you extract relevant information from an image file of a CV or resume which is usually difficult because unlike other documents, CV/Resume comes in random layouts, random fonts, multiple background colors which is why it's hard to get good extracted results. With our tool, you'll be able to detect the layout of the document and group text into relevant categories such as work experience, education, personal information, and more with an accuracy ranging from 70%-100%.

Our tool utilizes advanced algorithms for text recognition and layout detection, ensuring that the extracted information is accurate and reliable. Whether you're a recruiter looking to quickly scan through resumes, or an applicant hoping to improve your chances of getting hired, our CV/Resume extractor is here to help.
